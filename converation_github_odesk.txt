[3:54:49 PM] WSMassiv: Hi Grim, odesk - Eric here...
[3:55:09 PM] *** Grim has shared contact details with WSMassiv. ***
[3:55:15 PM] Grim: Hi Eric
[3:55:24 PM] WSMassiv: Hi Andrey
[3:55:43 PM] WSMassiv: So how are databases handled in situations like this?
[3:56:06 PM] Grim: I don't really understand your question...
[3:56:21 PM] Grim: can you specify it more detailed
[3:56:28 PM] WSMassiv: im using git to hold the files when developers edit, but if a database needs a structural change how do we track that?
[3:56:40 PM] Grim: Ah....
[3:56:53 PM] Grim: Developer should have its own database
[3:57:32 PM] Grim: and in case if he changes structure  in it ? he shoud save a query, to update the DB on production
[3:57:40 PM] Grim: thats how I do it now
[3:57:59 PM] Grim: git handles only code development and changes
[3:58:17 PM] WSMassiv: right
[3:58:43 PM] WSMassiv: so then if there are 3 developers working on this - what is your suggestion?
[3:58:55 PM] Grim: on DB ?
[3:58:59 PM] Grim: or on Code changes?
[3:59:02 PM] WSMassiv: on the whole thing
[3:59:14 PM] WSMassiv: yes some code changes will require table edits
[3:59:20 PM] WSMassiv: usually adding
[3:59:33 PM] WSMassiv: or changeing data types
[3:59:45 PM] Grim: easiest scheme:
[4:00:21 PM] WSMassiv: take your time im looking for ideas
[4:00:35 PM] Grim: each developer shoud create new branch for each feature he develops
[4:00:44 PM] Grim: and push it to github
[4:01:09 PM] Grim: you shoud time to time review thiis branches and merge them with Master
[4:01:32 PM] Grim: this is how new features will get to production
[4:02:27 PM] Grim: with each pull request ( request to merge with Master) developer can add needed SQL in pull request comment
[4:03:04 PM] Grim: and you will know that before merging this code to Master you should run some quries in DB
[4:04:21 PM] Grim: more difficult but more manageble way - is to implement task tracker and log every pull request and SQL query for each new feature in different tickets
[4:04:36 PM] Grim: like Redmine, Jira, Trello, etc
[4:06:41 PM] Grim: can you please close the current project ?
[4:07:39 PM] WSMassiv: yes this is a completed project
